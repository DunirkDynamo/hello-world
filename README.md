# hello-world
Hello, Reader. My name is Galahad. My pursuits on GitHub are mostly academic. I apply machine-learning algorithms to physics data, drawn from particle physics experiments, in order to distinguish background data from signal data. Presently I'm learning how to handle Big Data in order to analyze cosmological data and astrophysical data. Eventually I hope to apply CNNs to such data, merging my skills in machine-learning with Big Data analysis.

A secondary interest of mine is applying statistical techniques to gain slight advantages in sports betting. I have developped bootstrap algorithms in order to optimize rosters in head-to-head style hockey pools and have achieved remarkable success. In general, I think bootstrapping is a tragically underused approach. The essence of my success in bootstrapping for sports statistics is that I do not assume a particular model (e.g. normal, exponential, etc) for a player's ppg statistics. Instead, I allow the bootstrap to find the true model. 


Another minor curiosity/pursuit of mine is in developing real-time applications for gambling. For example, a program that keeps track of blackjack odds based on which cards have been dealt. This exact method of card counting outperforms approximate methods of card counting by miles.
